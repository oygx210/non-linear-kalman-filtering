function yk = vdpMeasurementNonAdditiveNoiseFcn2(xk,vk)
% vdpMeasurementNonAdditiveNoiseFcn Example measurement function for discrete
% time nonlinear state estimators with non-additive measurement noise.
%
% yk = vdpNonAdditiveMeasurementFcn(xk,vk)
%
% Inputs:
%    xk - x[k], states at time k
%    vk - v[k], measurement noise at time k
%
% Outputs:
%    yk - y[k], measurements at time k
%
% The measurement is the first state with multiplicative noise
yk = xk(1)*(1+vk) + sin(xk(2));
